4. Might of the Herd (To boost your normal attack damage and your last hitting)

horned strike scales horrible as well imo :> might of the herd, might be better to max before charge though but yeah, burst+longer stun > constant dps + slow for ganking imo, but it might still be better, dunno. never tried going like that tbh.

one in each in this order: horned, charge, might of the herd.
after that, i prio my skills; ulti > charge > might > horned.
